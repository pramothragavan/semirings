 The <B>Semirings</B> package provides tools for enumerating semirings and
 related algebraic structures of small orders.
 The package allows users to count and generate semirings up to isomorphism
 or equivalence using a rudimentary algorithm
 and the library of small semigroups provided by <B>Smallsemi</B>. It supports
 a variety of structures and offers extensibility to custom constraints.
 This package fills a gap in the literature by providing the first known
 counts (in many cases) of semirings and their variants up to equivalence.
<P/>
<Section Label="Section_defs">
<Heading>Definitions and Preliminaries</Heading>

 There are various definitions of semirings in the literature, and
 we make use of the following convention.
 A semiring is a set <Math>S</Math> with two binary operations, addition and
 multiplication, such that:
<List>
<Item>
The <Emph>additive reduct</Emph> \((S, +)\), which we denote by \(A\), is a commutative semigroup.
</Item>
<Item>
The <Emph>multiplicative reduct</Emph> \((S, \cdot)\), which we denote by \(M\), is a semigroup.
</Item>
<Item>
Multiplication distributes over addition, i.e. for all \(a, b, c \in S\),
</Item>
</List>
 \[a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c) \quad \text{and} \quad (b + c) \cdot a = (b \cdot a) + (c \cdot a).
 \]
 It is sometimes useful to consider a semiring <Math>S</Math> as the pair <Math>(A, M)</Math>. 
<P/>
 We will also make use of the prefix 'ai' to mean 'additively idempotent'.
 For instance, an <Emph>ai-semiring</Emph> <Math>S</Math> is a semiring with the additional property that
 \[a + a = a \quad \text{for all } a \in S.\]
<P/>
 We make use of the convention that rings do not necessarily have a
 multiplicative identity. 
<P/>
 In the remainder of this chapter, we discuss installation of the package.

 This software is designed for use with <B>GAP</B> version 4.5 or later.
 It also requires the <B>Smallsemi</B> package (version 0.7.2) and the
 <B>Semigroups</B> package (version 5.5.1 or higher) to function correctly.
<P/>
<Subsection Label="Chapter_Introduction_Section_Requirements_Subsection_RAM">
<Heading>RAM</Heading>

 Due to its dependence on <B>Smallsemi</B>, <B>Semirings</B> can use large
 amounts of RAM. For more information on how <B>GAP</B> uses memory, see
 <Ref BookName="ref" Sect="Command Line Options"
      Text=" GAP command-line options"/>.
 In the case that the user runs into memory issues, see
 <Ref BookName="Smallsemi" Sect="Memory Issues"
      Text="Smallsemi: Memory Issues"/>.

 The installation follows standard <B>GAP</B> rules as outlined in
 the following two steps; see
 <Ref BookName="ref" Sect="Installing a GAP Package"
      Text="Reference: Installing a GAP Package"/> for further details.
<List>
<Item>
Ensure that Semigroups version 4.5 or later is available.
</Item>
<Item>
Ensure that Smallsemi version 0.7.2 or later is available.
</Item>
<Item>
Download an archive of the package from <URL>https://pramothragavan.github.io/assets/semirings.tar.gz</URL>.
</Item>
<Item>
Move the archive inside a <F>pkg</F> directory. This can be either the
</Item>
</List>
 main <F>pkg</F> directory in your <B>GAP</B> installation or your personal
 <F>pkg</F> directory.
<List>
<Item>
Unzip and untar the file, this should create a directory called
</Item>
</List>
 <F>semirings</F> inside the <F>pkg</F> directory.
<List>
<Item>
Inside the <F>pkg/semirings</F> directory, in your terminal type

<Heading>Loading</Heading>

 To use the package, start a <B>GAP</B> session and type
 <Code>LoadPackage("semirings");</Code> at the <B>GAP</B> prompt. You should see
 the following:
<Example><![CDATA[

 You might want to start <B>GAP</B> with a specified amount of memory; see 
 <Ref BookName="Smallsemi" Sect="Memory Issues"
      Text="Smallsemi: Memory Issues"/>.

<Subsection Label="Chapter_Introduction_Section_Installation_Subsection_Testing">
<Heading>Testing</Heading>

 You should verify the success of the installation by running the test file.
 This is done by the following command and should return a similar output:
<Example><![CDATA[
