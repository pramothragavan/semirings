 The <B>Semirings</B> package provides a means of encoding and decoding
 into a format called <B>Semi6</B>, inspired by the <B>graph6</B> format.
<P/>
 <B>Semi6</B> encodes a semiring <Math>S = (A,M)</Math> of order <Math>n</Math> (two <Math>n \times n</Math>
 Cayley tables) as one short ASCII token.
<P/>
 The first byte is <Math>n + 63</Math>, exactly as in <B>graph6</B>.
 The payload is a bit-stream: first the upper triangle (diagonal included)
 of the symmetric table <Math>A</Math>, then the full table <Math>M</Math>. Each entry is stored
 in <Math>b = \lceil{\log_2 n\rceil}</Math> bits, most-significant bit first.
 Zero-bits are used for padding until the length is a multiple of 6.
 The stream is then divided into 6-bit blocks, each block has 63 added,
 and the resulting bytes (ASCII 63–126) are concatenated.
 Thus a semiring becomes one short, printable token that is identical
 in spirit
 to <B>graph6</B>, but with a variable‐width per-entry field instead of
 the single edge-bit used for graphs. That is to say, the <Math>b=1</Math> case
 effectively reduces to the <B>graph6</B> format (with an additional
 square table).

<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="S" Name="Semi6String" />
 <Returns>a string
</Returns>
 <Description>
The function <C>Semi6String(S)</C> encodes a semiring
 <C>S</C> into a string in the Semi6 format.

<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="f, srs, [mode]" Name="Semi6Encode" />
 <Description>
This function takes, a file or filename <A>f</A>, a list of
 semirings <A>srs</A>, and an optional mode <A>mode</A>.
 If <A>f</A> is a file, it writes the semirings in <C>srs</C> to the file in
 Semi6 format. If <A>f</A> is a string, it writes the semirings to a file
 with the name <A>f</A> in <B>Semi6</B> format.
<P/>
 <A>mode</A> can be either <C>"w"</C> or <C>"a"</C> (default), which
 determines the mode in which the file is opened for writing.
