\section{Introduction}

Enumeration of algebra and combinatorial structures of finite order up to
isomorphism is a classical topic. Among the algebraic structures considered are
groups~\cite{BESCHE2002,A000001}, rings~\cite{Blackburn2022, Fine1993,
Kruse1970, A027623}, near-rings~\cite{Chow2024, SONATA, A305858},
semigroups and monoids~\cite{Distler2010, Distler2010, Distler2013,
  Forsythe1955, Grillet1996, Grillet2014, Jrgensen1977, Motzkin1955,
Plemmons1967, A027851, A058129, Satoh1994, A001426, A001423},
inverse semigroups and monoids~\cite{Malandro2019, A001428, A234843,
A234844, A234845}, and many more too numerous to mention\footnote{The disparity
  in the number of references for semigroups and monoids and the other
  algebraic structures is a consequence of the authors familiarity with the
  literature for semigroups and monoids, and there are likely many other
  references that could have been included were it not for us not knowing about
them.}. In this short note we count the number of finite semirings up to
isomorphism and up to isomorphism and anti-isomorphism for $n \leq 6$. We also
count several special classes of semirings for (slightly) larger values of $n$.

This short note was initiated by an email from M. Volkov to the first author in
February of 2025 asking if it was possible to verify with \GAP that the number
of ai-semirings up to isomorphism with $4$ elements is $866$ in the
paper~\cite{Ren2025}; see also~\cite{Zhao2020} where it is shown that there are
61 ai-semirings of order $3$. After some initial missteps it was relatively
straightforward to verify that this number is correct, by using the library
of small semigroups in the \GAP package \Smallsemi. This short note arose
out from these first steps. In contrast to groups or rings, where the
numbers of non-isomorphic objects of order $n$ is known for relatively large
values of $n$, the number of semigroups of order $11$ (up to isomorphism) is
not known exactly. Given that $99.4\%$ of the semigroups of order $8$ are
$3$-nilpotent, that the number of $3$-nilpotent semigroups of order $11$ is
approximately $10 ^ {26}$~\cite{Distler2012ab}, this number is likely close
to the exact value; see also~\cite{Kleitman1976}. Perhaps unsurprisingly,
from the perspective of counting up to isomorphism, it seems that semirings
have more in common with semigroups than with rings or groups. Roughly
speaking, rings and groups are highly structured, providing strong
constraints that enable their enumeration. On the other hand, semigroups,
and seemingly semirings also, are less structured, more numerous, and
consequently harder to enumerate.

We begin with the definition of a semiring; which is a natural generalisation
of the notion of a ring.

\begin{defn}[Semiring]
  \label{def:semiring}
  A \emph{semiring} is a set \(S\) equipped with two binary
  operations \(+\) and  \(\times\) such that:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \((S, +)\) is a commutative semigroup ($(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$
      and $x + y = y + x$ for all $x, y, z\in S$);
    \item \((S, \times)\) is a semigroup ($x\times (y \times z) = (x\times
      y)\times z$ for all $x,y, z\in S$); and
    \item multiplication $\times$ distributes over addition $+$
      ($x \times (y + z) = (x \times y) + (x \times z)$ and
      $(y + z) \times x = (y \times x) + (z \times x)$ for all $x, y, z \in S$).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

We note that some authors require that $(S, +)$ is a commutative monoid with
(additive) identity denoted $0$ where $x\times 0 = 0 \times x = 0$ for all $x\in
S$; see, for example, \cite{Lothaire2005, Sakarovitch2009}.
We do not add this requirement, and refer to such objects as \textit{semirings
with zero}. The numbers of semirings with zero are discussed
in~\cite{stackexchange} and in~\cite{jipsen}; see
also~\cite{baueralg} which we will discuss a little further below.

Recall that if $(S, \times)$ and $(T, \otimes)$ are semigroups, then $\phi:S
\to T$ is a \textit{(semigroup) homomorphism} if $(x\times y)\phi =
(x)\phi\otimes (y)\phi$ for all $x, y\in S$. Note that we write mappings to the
right of their arguments and compose them from left to right. If $\phi: S \to
T$ is a semigroup homomorphism and $\phi$ is bijective, then $\phi$ is an
\textit{(semigroup) isomorphism}. If a semigroup isomorphism from a semigroup
$(S, \times)$ to itself is called an \textit{automorphism}
and the group of all such automorphisms is denoted $\Aut(S, \times)$.

In this short note we are concerned with counting semirings up to isomorphism,
and so our next definition is that of an isomorphism.

\begin{defn}[Semiring isomorphism]\label{defn-semiring-iso}
  We say that two semirings \((S,+,\times)\) and \((S, \oplus, \otimes)\) are
  \emph{isomorphic} if there exists a bijection \(\phi: S \to S\) which is
  simultaneously a semigroup isomorphism from $(S, +)$ to $(S, \oplus)$ and
  from $(S, \times)$ to $(S, \otimes)$. We refer to $\phi$ as a
  \textit{(semiring) isomorphism}.
\end{defn}

Since a semiring is comprised of two semigroups, enumerating semirings is
equivalent to enumerating those pairs consisting of an additive semigroup $(S,
+)$ and a multiplicative semigroup $(S, \times)$ such that $\times$ distributes
over $+$. The next theorem indicates which $(S, \times)$ we should consider
for each of the additive semigroups $(S, +)$.

We denote the symmetric group on the set $S$ by $\Sym(S)$. If $\sigma\in
\Sym(S)$ and $\cdot: S \times S \to S$ is a binary operation, then we define
the binary operation $\cdot ^ \sigma: S\times S \to S$ by
\begin{equation}\label{equation-action}
  x \cdot ^ \sigma y = ((x)\sigma^{-1} \cdot (y)\sigma ^ {-1})\sigma.
\end{equation}
It is straightforward to verify that \eqref{equation-action} is a (right, group)
action of $\Sym(S)$ on the set of all binary operations on $S$. Clearly if
$\cdot$ is associative, then so too is $\cdot ^ \sigma$ for every $\sigma \in
\Sym(S)$. The group of automorphisms $\Aut(S,\cdot)$ of a
semigroup $(S, \cdot)$ coincides with the stabiliser of the operation $\cdot$
under the action of $\Sym(S)$ defined in \eqref{equation-action}.

Recall that if $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of a group $G$, then the
\textit{double cosets} $H\backslash G / K$ are the sets of the form
$\{hgk\mid h\in H, k \in K\}$ for $g\in G$.
The next theorem is key to our approach for counting semirings.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:isomorphism-condition}
  Let \((S, +)\) be a commutative semigroup, let \((S, \times)\) be a semigroup,
  and let \(\sigma, \tau\in\Sym(S)\) be such that $(S, +, \times ^ \sigma)$ and
  $(S, +, \times ^ \tau)$ are semirings.
  Then \((S, +, \times ^ \sigma)\) and \((S, +, \times^\tau)\) are isomorphic
  if and only if \(\sigma\) and \(\tau\) belong to the same double coset of
  \(\Aut(S, \times) \backslash \Sym(S) / \Aut(S, +)\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose that $\phi$ is a semiring isomorphism from
  $(S, +, \times ^ \sigma)$ to $(S, +, \times^\tau)$. Then
  $\phi \in \Aut(S, +)$ and $(x \times ^ \sigma y)\phi = (x)\phi\times ^ \tau
  (y)\phi$ for all $x, y\in S$. It follows that
  \[
    ((x)\sigma ^ {-1} \times (y)\sigma ^ {-1})\sigma \phi \tau ^ {-1} =
    (x \times ^ \sigma y)\phi\tau ^ {-1}
    = ((x)\phi \times ^ {\tau} (y)\phi)\tau ^ {-1}
    = (x)\phi\tau ^ {-1} \times (y)\phi\tau ^ {-1}.
  \]
  If we set $\gamma = \sigma\phi\tau^{-1}$, $p =
  (x)\sigma^{-1}$, and $q=(y)\sigma^{-1}$, then
  $(p\times q)\gamma = (p)\gamma \times (q)\gamma$
  and so $\gamma, \gamma ^ {-1} \in \Aut(S, \times)$.
  Rearranging we obtain $\tau = \gamma^{-1}\sigma\phi$. Since $\phi \in
  \Aut(S, +)$, we conclude that $\tau$ and $\sigma$ lie in the
  same double coset of $\Aut(S, \times) \backslash \Sym(S) / \Aut(S, +)$.

  ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose that $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are in the
  same double coset of $\Aut(S, +) \backslash \Sym(S) / \Aut(S, \times)$.
  Then there exists $\alpha\in\Aut(S, \times)$ and $\beta\in\Aut(S, +)$ such
  that $\tau=\alpha\sigma\beta$.

  We will show that $\beta$ is a semiring isomorphism from $(S, +, \times
  ^{\sigma})$ to $(S, +, \times^{\tau})$. Since $\beta\in \Aut(S, +)$, it
  suffices to show that $\beta$ is an isomorphism from $(S, \times
  ^{\sigma})$ and $(S, \times^{\tau})$:
  \begin{align*}
    (x\times^\sigma y)\beta
    &= (x\sigma ^{-1} \times y\sigma ^{-1})\sigma \beta
    = (x\sigma ^{-1} \times y\sigma ^{-1})\alpha^{-1}\tau
    = (x\sigma ^{-1}\alpha^{-1} \times y\sigma ^{-1}\alpha^{-1})\tau &&
    \alpha^{-1} \in \Aut(S, \times)\\
    &= (x\beta\tau^{-1} \times y\beta\tau^{-1})\tau
    = (x\beta \times^{\tau} y\beta).\qedhere
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

If $(S, \times)$ and $(S, \otimes)$ are semigroups, then $(S, \times)$ is said
to be \textit{anti-isomorphic} to $(S, \otimes)$ if there exists a bijection
$\phi: S \to S$ such that $(x\times y)\phi = y\otimes x$ for all $x, y\in S$.
The bijection $\phi$ is referred to as an \textit{anti-isomorphism}. If the
operations $\times$ and $\otimes$ coincide, then $\phi$ is an anti-isomorphism.
Clearly the composition of two anti-isomorphisms is an automorphism, and the
composition of an anti-isomorphism and an isomorphism is an anti-isomorphism.
As such the set of all automorphisms or anti-automorphisms forms a group under
composition of functions; we denote this group by $\Aut^*(S, \times)$. Note
that $\Aut(S, \times)$ is an index two subgroup of $\Aut^*(S, \times)$.

Similarly, using the obvious analogue of \cref{defn-semiring-iso}, we can
define anti-isomorphic semirings. It is routine to adapt the proof of
\cref{thm:isomorphism-condition} to prove the following.

\begin{cor}
  \label{cor:equiv-condition}
  Let \((S, +)\) be a commutative semigroup, let \((S, \times)\) be a
  semigroup, and let \(\sigma, \tau\in\Sym(S)\) be such that $(S, +, \times ^
  \sigma)$ and $(S, +, \times ^ \tau)$ are semirings. Then \((S, +, \times ^
  \sigma)\) and \((S, +, \times^\tau)\) are isomorphic or anti-isomorphic if
  and only if \(\sigma\) and \(\tau\) belong to the same double coset of
  \(\Aut^*(S, \times) \backslash \Sym(S) / \Aut(S, +)\).
\end{cor}

\section{Tables of results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

It follows from \cref{thm:isomorphism-condition} and \cref{cor:equiv-condition}
that to enumerate the semirings on a set $S$ up to isomorphism (or up to
isomorphism and anti-isomorphism) it suffices to consider every commutative
semigroup $(S, +)$ and semigroup $(S, \times)$ and to compute representatives
of the double cosets \(\Aut(S, \times) \backslash \Sym(S) / \Aut(S, +)\) (or
\(\Aut^*(S, \times) \backslash \Sym(S) / \Aut(S, +)\)). The semigroups up to
isomorphism and anti-isomorphism are available in \Smallsemi.  Since $S$ is
small, it is relatively straightforward to can compute $\Aut(S, \times)$ and
$\Aut(S, +)$ (using the \Semigroups package for \GAP, which reduces
  the problem to that of computing the automorphisms of a graph
associated to $\Aut(S, \times)$ using \bliss). \GAP contains
functionality for computing double coset
representatives based. % TODO add "based on \cite{}."
This is the approach implemented by the authors of the current paper in the
\GAP package \Semirings to compute the numbers in this section.

Below are some tables listing the numbers of semirings (\cref{def:semiring}),
up to isomorphism, and up to isomorphism or anti-isomorphism, with various
properties for some small values of $n\in \mathbb{N}$.
As far as we know, many of the numbers in these tables were not previously
known. In particular, we are not aware of any results in the literature about
the number of semirings up to isomorphism and anti-isomorphism.
Some of the numbers in the tables below can be found using
\cite{baueralg}, although this approach is considerably slower than the
approach described here, largely because the precomputed data for small
semigroups available in \Smallsemi does a lot of heavy lifting.

These tables are only a sample of the results that can be obtained
using \Semirings.

% * semifields
% * zero sum free
